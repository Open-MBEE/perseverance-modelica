Perseverance
=====

This is a model of the Perseverance rover. 

Prerequisites
-------
The model package is based on **Vehicle Dynamics Library** and **Electrification Library** from Modelon. All prerequisites are included in an installation of **Modelon Impact Pro**. The models can also be used in Dymola with separate installations of the required libraries, though the visualizers (glb files) are not supported.

Quick start
--------

In Perseverance.Experiments there are four example experiments that can be simulated out of the box:
 - **FlatPad** - Standing still on flat ground
 - **DrivingFlat** - Driving forward on flat ground at a constant speed
 - **DrivingCleats** - Driving over a rectangular cleat at a constant speed
 - **Spin** - Spin in place by driving wheels on each side in opposite directions and adding the appropriate steering angles to the corner wheels
